        I am a 2nd-year student at SRM Institute of Science and Technology in
        India, pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science Engineering. I have a keen
        interest in coding and have learned Python, MYSQL, C++, Front-End.
        Currently, I am learning the fundamentals of Full Stack Development. So
        far in the past six months, I have learned Front-End Development and
        Open-Source coding. I'm a quick learner who can rise to any challenge
        with ingenuity and perseverance. I'm always interested in hearing about
        other people's experiences, so I'd be happy to talk about your
        experiences.
